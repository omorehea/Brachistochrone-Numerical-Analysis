# Brachistochrone-Numerical-Analysis
A numerical method to computing the brachistochrone curve and analyzing its time of fastest descent against other general non-monotonic curves.
One can find matlab files which all use the same numerical method to make different plots and analyze the brachistochrone against other curves.
